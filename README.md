# hello-world
Where it all begins.

Vince here! Trying to get used to this whole github thing instead of just a cluster of files lying (neatly) around my file system. Mostly using this as a place to store practice programs from things like SQLZoo, Learning Python the Hard Way, Code Academy, HackerRank, and [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer). Maybe in the future I'll have some interesting original content to post here.
